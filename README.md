# Express.js API with Swagger Documentation

This is a simple Express.js application that serves as an API with Swagger documentation. It includes endpoints for retrieving book information and creating new books, all while providing Swagger documentation for easy usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the Express.js server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Swagger Documentation

You can explore and interact with the API using Swagger UI. The Swagger documentation is available at:

```

Swagger UI provides an interactive interface to view and test the API endpoints.
